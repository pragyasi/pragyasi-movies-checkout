2. Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?
Answer : Got more hands on working with react hooks . 
3. What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?
Answer : Since there was time constraint . I didn't get chance to add a success page to the application when a user selects yes on the confirmation modal . 
4. How could the application be improved?
Answer ;I couldn't implement all the design ideas I had in mind . The impriovements I would do is : 
    a. Use a redux store or a single object store and use react hook to dispatch the actions to ensure smooth and consistent flow of data exchange between components.
    b.Modularize the code more into components so to make them more resuable . 
    c.Use a ghost image for no image available .
    d.Implement load spinner component while waiting for data from API . 
    e. Implement pagination in form of lazy loading/carousel so to not overburden the DOM .
